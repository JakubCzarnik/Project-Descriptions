# Portfolio
In this repository, I present my projects and skills. Each of them is briefly described, and under the descriptions, there are links to detailed descriptions available in both Polish and English.

## Machine Learning
I have implemented six popular algorithms used in classical machine learning, using the **C++** language and the **Eigen** library. I created from scratch a class responsible for loading and processing data, functions necessary for training, and example applications of each algorithm.

## Deep Machine learning

Using only the **Numpy** library in **Python**, I implemented key algorithms necessary to create and conduct training of custom neural networks. I used the **MNIST** dataset to train an image **classifier** and a **Generative Adversarial Network** (**GAN**) responsible for generating images.

## Computer vision

Using the **TensorFlow** library in **Python**, I implemented an advanced object detection model compatible with the architecture of the latest **YOLOv8** models. I developed functions for dynamically adjusting **bounding boxes** (**bbox**) to speed up training time and increase the efficiency of the model. Additionally, I implemented appropriate metrics for model evaluation, **callbacks** for analyzing the course of training, and used the **Non-Maximum Suppression** (**NMS**) algorithm.
